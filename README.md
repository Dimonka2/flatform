# flatform
Form helper for Laravel and laravelcollective/html

This is just an idea. Not even an alpha version. 

## Features

- **Possibility to switch styles via config.** It is possible to declare several styles and switch between them. Option to switch styles at runtime is coming soon.

- **Write less code.** Using this apprach you define control styles once and focus only on inteface declaration.
